Here's a breakdown of action points from the meeting transcript, focusing on specific details:

**I. Website UI/UX Improvements:**

* **A. Improve Search Functionality:**
    * **Action:** Change placeholder text in all search bars (except the Explore Menus page) to "Search chefs and menus."
    * **Priority:** High (easy implementation, potential for significant impact).
    * **Assigned To:**  (Not explicitly assigned in the transcript, likely the design/development team).
* **B. Clarify Location Search:**
    * **Action 1:** Add a note below the location search bar on all relevant pages: "Don't see your city?" followed by a secondary search bar.
    * **Action 2:** Create a mockup of this design change.
    * **Priority:** Medium (requires design and development).
    * **Assigned To:** (Not explicitly assigned, likely the design team initially, then development).
* **C. Enhance Mobile Navigation:**
    * **Action 1:** Add dots to indicate more menu items are available beyond the initially visible one on the mobile version.
    * **Action 2:** Implement a subtle animation (e.g., a bouncing arrow) to draw attention to the hidden menu items, triggered when the user lands on the Explore Menus page. The animation should disappear after the user interacts with it.
    * **Action 3:**  Consider adding a "swipe for more" message, but prioritize the animation first due to concerns about visual clutter.
    * **Priority:** High (mobile is 70% of traffic, so significant impact potential).
    * **Assigned To:** (Not explicitly assigned, likely the front-end development team).
* **D. Redesign Homepage Navigation (Mobile):**
    * **Action:** Move the hamburger menu to the bottom of the screen (in a bottom toolbar), move existing top navigation elements up, and include all major navigation options (How it Works, etc.) in the bottom menu.
    * **Priority:** High (significant impact on mobile usability).
    * **Assigned To:** (Not explicitly assigned, likely the design and front-end development teams).
* **E.  Homepage Bottom Navigation Bar (Desktop):**
    * **Action:** Consider adding a bottom navigation bar on the desktop version of the homepage, similar to Airbnb's website, containing Explore, Wishlist, and Login/Signup options.  If not logging in, clicking these would trigger a signup/login popup; after logging in, these would link to the appropriate pages.
    * **Priority:** Medium (potential significant impact, requires design and development, and consideration of how it integrates with the existing design).
    * **Assigned To:** (Not explicitly assigned, likely the design and front-end development teams).
* **F.  Mobile Hamburger Menu and Location Bar:**
    * **Action:** Decide whether to keep the location search bar at the top of the mobile page alongside the hamburger menu or move it.
    * **Priority:** Medium (impacts mobile layout).
    * **Assigned To:** Design team.


**II.  Backend/Module Development:**

* **A. Service Provider Modules:**
    * **Action:** Continue working on the designs, modules, and backend for service provider modules.
    * **Priority:** High (ongoing development).
    * **Assigned To:** Adil and the backend development team.
* **B. Guest Pricing Display:**
    * **Action:** Display guest pricing at the top half of the card, as previously discussed.
    * **Priority:** High.
    * **Assigned To:** (Not explicitly assigned, likely the front-end development team).


**III.  Other:**

* **A. System Reboot Issue:**
    * **Action:**  Document the system reboot issue and its resolution (already resolved).
    * **Priority:** Low (already resolved).
    * **Assigned To:** The person who experienced the issue (already completed).


**Note:**  The transcript lacks explicit assignment of tasks to specific individuals. This information would need to be clarified within the team.  Priorities are subjective and may need adjustment based on project deadlines and resource availability.
